Title
-------
minimum density power divergence 

Version
-------
1.0.0


Description
-------
This package estimates  coefficients of a high-dimensional linear regression model. Significantly different from the existing studies, we adopt loss functions based on 
minimum density power divergence (MDPD) criteria. Multiple published studies have shown that this approach outperforms alternatives under low dimensional situations, especially when normality assumption is violated. We extend this method to  a high dimensional situation and also observe the robust performance. Penalization is used for identification and regularized estimation. Computationally, we develop an effective algorithm which utilizes the coordinate descent. Simulation shows that the proposed approach has satisfactory performance.
